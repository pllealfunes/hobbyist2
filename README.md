# Hobbyist

A blogging website where users can blog about their hobbies, explore new
ideas, and discover new passions. 

This project was built with using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, React, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, Unsplash, Storyset and deployed on Render for the 2023 Harvard Extension School Capstone project. 

This project is my first MERN Stack project and had to learn React, Redux Toolkit, Material UI and JWT Tokens. I learned and used Figma to create design of the project but improved the design along the way. I am proud of my first MERN project and look forward to improving it. 

This project is my copyright material and using it will attract legal action.
